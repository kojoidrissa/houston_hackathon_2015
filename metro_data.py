'''
I'm trying to create the minimum data set we need for the
"Find stuff near me by public transit" app
Here's what we need from the following tables:

##STOPS
-  stop_id: Use to search STOP_TIMES for trip_id. Those are the routes
    Then, you can use THOSE routes to identify which of the separated
    STOP_TIMES files to search.
-  stop_lat
-  stop_long
-  stop_name

##STOP_TIMES
-  trip_id: Foreign Key for the TRIPS table 
-  arrival_time: for calculating "how long will I be on the bus"
-  departure_time: for calculating "how long will I be on the bus"
-  stop_id: Foreign Key for STOPS table
-  stop_sequence

##TRIPS
-  trip_id
-  route_id: Foreign Key for ROUTES table

##ROUTES
-  route_id
-  route_short_name: Display for user
-  route_long_name: Display for user

import csv
with open('stop_times_mini.csv', newline='') as csvfile:
    spamreader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=' ', quotechar='|')
    for row in spamreader:
        print(', '.join(row))

import csv
with open('eggs.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    spamwriter = csv.writer(csvfile, delimiter=' ',
                            quotechar='|', quoting=csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL)
