##Intro
Houston has a LOT of awesome attractions. 

But getting to them is often difficult. Public transit COULD take you to many of them. But which attractions can you reach via public transit near you?

MetroAttractions helps you find the best of Houston, along public transit lines. 

BENEFITS TO THE CITY
This starts a move towards Transit Oriented Development, where more economic activity moves to towards transit lines.  

If you **KNOW** where you want to go and you want to use public transit, Google Maps or the Harris County MTA's app will get you there. But what if you **don't** know where you want to go?
