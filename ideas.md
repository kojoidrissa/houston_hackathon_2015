#What do I want to work on?
From sample projects at http://houstonhackathon.com/

##Yelp Scraper for Food Poisoning: From City of Houston Health & Human Services
Develop an app that scrapes Yelp for potential incidents of food poisioning.  You could use [this scraper](https://github.com/codelucas/yelpcrawl) to start, and configure it to look for the right terms

I think this is what Amanda & Neeraj are working on. 

##Economic Model of Arts and Culture: From First Person
*Houston has a thriving arts community, but itâ€™s economic impact is underestimated.  Develop a new model and infographic of the impact of arts and culture on the Houston economy.  This could incorporate revenue from tourism, employment, sales tax, and more.  This could also model the impact of specific events in Houston, such as the Pride Parade.  A good template and data source is the [HAA report on the creative economy](http://houstonartsalliance.com/images/uploads/main/Creative_Economy_-_Report_(2012).pdf).*


##Understanding Food Distribution Performance: From Houston Food Bank
*The Houston Food Bank has 255 agencies that distribute food in the Houston region.  Using performance data that they provide, cross-reference the agency locations with publicly available datasets, such as public transit stops and grocery store locations.*

##Ideal Bike Map: From Open Houston
Using the [Strava bike heatmap](http://labs.strava.com/heatmap/#12/-95.43815/29.76784/blue/bike) and existing bike lane maps, determine the ideal bike communiting patterns and recommend street changes to the City. Would be good to get [PWE](http://www.publicworks.houstontx.gov/home) on board & releasing datasets

I also wonder if I could combine the above data with bus data or Google Maps Transit data to create transit directions that COMBINE bike and bus routes?

##Educate the Public on Transgender Issues: From First Person

##Open Data Survey: From Open Houston

##Sunlight Foundation
They have [all sorts of APIs](http://sunlightfoundation.com/api/) and a [tutorial on how to use them](http://training.sunlightfoundation.com/module/unlocking-api/). They also have practice lessons for their Capitol Words API on Codecademy for [Python](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/sunlight_python) and [JavaScript](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/sunlight_javascript)
